coursework for SNHU CS-370 Emerging trends in CS

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The project goal was to create a non-player character of a pirate to compete against the player in navigating the maze in a treasure hunt game to find the treasure.  The pirate would be an intelligent agent and we were to create a deep Q-learning algorithm to train the agent. The code in GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py were provided.  In addition most of the code in TreasureHuntGame was provided which includes setting of global variables including the epsilon, creating the neural network layers, and the completion check function.  The code block that is labeled as updated by the student was created by myself.  This code encompasses creating the for each epoch loop, creating the while game is not over loop, and setting the training epochs and batch size.  These last 2 factors were adjusted for experiments on how to improve the speed of training within the resource limits of the Codio environment. The training was successful and after several experiments the training speed was decreased by approximately 1/4 of the original training time.  Further experimentation may have lead to more improvement but time constraits were a limiting factor. 


Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

AI is currently a big trend in the computer science field.  Learning the basics of machine learning, how to implement it, as well as, how to adjust for particular needs and environments, allows one to remain relevant within the industry. 


What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

A computer scientist designs software to solve complex problems using technology. Modern society is fundamentally shaped by their work, which is now a key factor driving innovation across many fields.Â 


How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I move through the bullet points of requirements systematically to make sure the software covers all project needs.  Once the basics are covered I work to improve flow and logic where needed.  I then go back through code and ensure commenting and naming conventions are consistent with industry standards. 


What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

To follow best practices for secure coding, respect user's right to privacy, maintain all transparency possible all while creating an approprate solution for the project requirements.  Software developers need to consider the ethical implications of any decisions made when creating software.  Like physicians, software developers endeavor not only to do no harm, but create work that will benefit the user, the organization and humanity as a whole.
